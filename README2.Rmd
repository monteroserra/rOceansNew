This is a trial of the readme file that should explain usage of the different functions 
included in the package. 

```{r}

devtools::install_github("monteroserra/rOceansNew")
library(rOceansNew)

# Here we need to upload the databases downloaded from OBIS and GBIF 
# (example stored in rOceansData at GitHub)

setwd("C:/Users/monteroserra/Desktop/rOceans Google Summer Code/Example_Acropora")
Acropora_OBIS = read.csv2("Acropora_OBIS.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
Acropora_GBIF = read.csv2("Acropora_GBIF.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
